This open-source Google Sheets Add-on provides a user-friendly sidebar interface for managing spreadsheet data. Its dynamic form automatically adapts to your sheetâ€™s headers and supports dropdown menus populated from specified ranges (e.g., Suppliers from contacts!A:A). Core features include searching records by ID, editing existing entries, adding new records, navigating between records, and protecting formula cells. Configuration is handled via a dedicated Dropdowns sheet, ensuring seamless data entry and updates while preserving data integrity and supporting filtered views.

The Add-on can also be deployed as a web app, allowing users to work with the data without ever opening the spreadsheet itself.
